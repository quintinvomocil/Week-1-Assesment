// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

Planning
Analysis of Requirements
Design
Implementation
Testing & Integration
Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle
    and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added."
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which the expectations of the required fucntions of the software are determined."
const design = "This is the third step, in which you construct the structure of the code."
const implemenation = "This is the fourth step, in which you actually write the code that you have planned for."
const testingAndImplementation = "This is the fifth step, in which you test the code and make sure that it is running properly and debug if anything needs to be fixed."
const maintain = "This is the final step, in which you consistently go back through the code and make sure it is up to date and running smoothly."
